My todo-list final project

In this readme i will explain about my project.

first i created the html file where i added all the basics and created the main elements i will work with in my JS code.
After all the basics were finished i moved on to the JS code where i began work on the actual project.

JS functions:
-addElements()
    This function creates all the elements that need to be inside a todo container, adds them a class and later on appends them
    to the container. inside this function i created two event listeners that change the priority of the current todo-container and
    assigned them to the increase and decrease priority buttons inside the container. After the container is done, he is being appended to
    the view section and increases the counter.

-assignValues(container,priority,date,text)
    This function gets a container and all the necessary values that needs to be inside it and assigns them into it's elements.
    After the container is complete the function resets the text-input and adds class according to the priority via a function i will acknowledge later.

-addToList(){
    This function uses both of the function above to add a todo-container to the view-section and into the JSON.bin and is being assigned 
    to the add-button as an eventListener.

-convertTimeFormat(date)
    This function gets a date as an argument to slice and modify it to an SQL format.

-counterChange()
    This function updates the counter to match the amount of todo-containers inside the view section and changing its following text.

-prioritize()
    This function sorts the view section by priority in descending order and is assigned to the sort button as an eventListener.

-priorityClass()
    This function sets a class for the container depending on its priority.

-checked()
    This function adds a "checked" style to all the containers with a checked checkbox

-deleteChecked()
    This function deletes all the containers with a checked checkbox and is assigned to the delete button
